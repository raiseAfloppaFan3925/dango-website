
About Dango
===========

.. note::

    This page is just me explaining why Dango exists and why this website exists.

.. tip::

    Use ``Alt + F4`` because this page sucks.

Dango, as a programming language, became an idea after I looked at my newly-created esolang concept "39h 41m of suffering" or something
like that, which was supposed to be a thematic language but ended up becoming a nightmare to conceptualize and program in. It did NOT
become thematic, and now lives in my Esolang wiki sandbox page.

Then, after one related music video that is a sibling to the video that gave me the idea for 39h 41m of suffering, I got the idea. Dango
had entered the idea stage. I checked out `dango (the food) <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dango>`__ and immediately got the best idea.
"What about a language where the code is dango?" I thought. Then I immediately went to making a concept in Markdown, and made an Esolang wiki
page for it. I kept refining it until I got bored, then I thought about making an implementation. However, since I hate making frontends, I made
the runtime first. It was terrible, and it sucked and violated the concept. And then a bunch of other stuff blah blah blah, then I created the
``README.md``, which is where I took inspiration from `pythOwO <https://github.com/virejdasani/pythOwO>`__ and `Rust <https://rust-lang.org>`__.

Now about this website. I wanted to make a website, so I immediately went to Sphinx. Then got bored and wanted to make my own design, then gave up,
and found a very cool theme. And now I have my first successful project.
