
Installing Dango
================

Currently, there is no way to install Dango other than from source.

To install Dango from source, run this command. (Requires Git)

.. code-block:: shell
    
    git clone https://github.com/raiseAfloppaFan3925/dango-esolang.git

Then, build it using ``cargo build --release``. If you want to use Dango from the command line,
then add the executable to your ``PATH`` environment variable.
